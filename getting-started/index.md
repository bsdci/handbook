In this section you'll learn how to get iocage and all its dependencies installed, as well as how to get a basic `jail` running.

The most basic prerequisite is a system with at least FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE.
There are plans to make iocage work on [all systems supporting ZFS](milestone link), but some of our [dependencies](issues link) will first need porting.
