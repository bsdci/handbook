iocage is a jail/container manager fusioning some of the best features and technologies the FreeBSD operating system has to offer. It is geared for ease of use with a simple and easy to understand command syntax.

This library provides programmatic access to iocage features and jails, while aiming to be compatible with iocage-legacy, and the current Python 3 version of ioc.
